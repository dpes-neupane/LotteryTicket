# LOTTERY TICKET HYPOTHESIS 

This project deals with regularizing a simple neural network using the unstructured pruning method put forth by [Frankle et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635). 

A simple neural network of 4 hidden layers (2048, 512, 64, 32) is pruned by the __Iterative Pruning Algorithm__ as given in the paper by Frankle et al. Here, the model has been pruned and performs better than the original after pruning about 33% of the original weights.
